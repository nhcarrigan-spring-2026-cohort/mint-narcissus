# Contributing to Mint Narcissus

Thank you for contributing to **Mint Narcissus**, a global cohort project built as part of the Spring 2026 cohort.

This document outlines how we collaborate, communicate, and contribute effectively as a distributed team.

---

## Cohort Values

This project follows the core principles of the cohort:

- Learning by building real-world projects
- Collaboration over competition
- Clear communication and respectful feedback
- Consistent progress over perfection
- Ownership and accountability

Everyone here is learning — mistakes are expected and encouraged as part of growth.

---

## Branching Strategy

We use a simple, industry-standard workflow:

### Main Branches

- `main` → stable, production-ready code
- `dev` → active development branch

### Feature Branches

Do NOT push anything directly to `main` or `dev`. Create branches from `dev` using the format:

- `feature/<short-description>`
- `fix/<short-description>`
- `docs/<short-description>`

Examples - feature/login-ui, fix/api-error, docs/update-readme

---

## Issues

Before starting work:

1. Check existing issues
2. Assign yourself to an issue
3. Ask questions in the issue or on Discord if unclear

Each issue should clearly define:

- What needs to be done
- Acceptance criteria (when applicable)

---

## Pull Requests (PRs)

All contributions must be made via Pull Requests.

### PR Guidelines

- Keep PRs **small and focused**
- Link the related issue (e.g. `Closes #12`)
- Add screenshots or recordings for UI changes
- Write clear descriptions

### PR Checklist

- [ ] Code works locally
- [ ] No unnecessary files included
- [ ] Follows project structure
- [ ] Linked to an issue

PRs require at least **one approval** before merging.

---

## Communication

- Daily updates are encouraged
- Use Discord for:
  - Questions
  - Blockers
  - Clarifications
- Be respectful and constructive in all feedback

---

## Code Quality

- Write readable, maintainable code
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Comment when logic is not obvious
- Refactor when needed, but keep scope limited

---

## Code Reviews

When reviewing:

- Be kind and specific
- Focus on the code, not the person
- Suggest improvements, don’t demand them

When receiving reviews:

- Ask questions if unclear
- Don’t take feedback personally
- Apply changes thoughtfully

---

## What Not To Do

- Don’t work on large features without an issue
- Don’t push directly to protected branches
- Don’t stay blocked silently — ask for help
- Don’t rewrite someone else’s work without discussion

---

## 📌 Final Note

This project is a shared learning experience.

Your goal is not just to ship features, but to:

- Learn professional workflows
- Practice teamwork
- Build something meaningful together

Thank you for contributing 🌱
