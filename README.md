## Project Overview

### Interview Outfit Coordinator

**“Look good, land the job.”**

Job interviews are stressful enough without worrying about whether you have appropriate clothes to wear. This platform connects people who need interview-appropriate outfits with donors who have professional clothing to give.

The key is dignity — this isn't a thrift store vibe, it's more like "borrow my lucky blazer." How do you match people with clothes that fit and suit the job they're interviewing for? How do you handle sizing sensitively? And how do you make someone feel confident walking into that interview, not like they're wearing someone's castoffs?
